# Security Analysis - OTP Sharp CLI

## Executive Summary

The OTP Sharp CLI application has undergone significant security hardening. Most critical and high-priority vulnerabilities have been addressed. **2 low-priority issues** remain for future improvement.

## Current Security Posture

### ✅ Security Strengths

1. **Strong Cryptographic Foundation**
   - AES-256-CBC encryption with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation
   - 300,000 PBKDF2 iterations (meets modern security standards)
   - Cryptographically secure random number generation for salt and IV

2. **Memory Security**
   - Encryption keys cleared from memory after use (CryptoHelper.cs:58, 125)
   - Password bytes securely cleared (CryptoHelper.cs:52, 119)
   - SecureString used throughout for password handling (ConsoleUI.cs:8-50)
   - Unmanaged memory properly zeroed (CryptoHelper.cs:61, 128, 149)

3. **Input Validation**
   - Strict Base32 validation with immediate failure on invalid characters (TotpGenerator.cs:51-84)
   - JSON deserialization protected with MaxDepth limits (CryptoHelper.cs:75)
   - Base64 validation before decryption (CryptoHelper.cs:88-91)
   - Null and empty input checks throughout

4. **Path Security**
   - Path traversal protection with directory whitelisting (Program.cs:33-62)
   - Restricted to user profile and application data directories
   - Full path resolution to prevent `..` traversal attacks

5. **Secure TOTP Implementation**
   - RFC 6238 compliant with proper HMAC-SHA1
   - 30-second time steps, 6-digit codes
   - Secure counter-based generation

## Remaining Issues

### Low Priority

#### 1. Secret Key Memory Exposure - LOW
**File:** OtpAccount.cs:6
**Issue:** TOTP secrets stored as plain strings in memory

**Impact:** Secrets could be exposed through memory dumps or swap files. However, secrets are stored encrypted on disk, limiting the attack surface to runtime memory access.

**Mitigation Options:**
- Store secrets as byte arrays with explicit clearing
- Implement IDisposable pattern for OtpAccount
- Consider memory pinning for sensitive data

#### 2. Information Disclosure - LOW
**File:** Program.cs:27-30
**Issue:** Generic exception handler may expose stack traces or sensitive error details

**Current Code:**
```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"ERROR: {ex.Message}");
}
```

**Recommendation:**
```csharp
catch (CryptographicException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ERROR: Encryption/decryption failed");
}
catch (IOException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ERROR: Database file access failed");
}
catch (Exception)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ERROR: An unexpected error occurred");
}
```

### Future Enhancements

#### File Permission Restrictions (Optional)
**File:** AccountStorage.cs:38
**Enhancement:** Set explicit file permissions on Unix systems

```csharp
if (Environment.OSVersion.Platform == PlatformID.Unix)
{
    File.SetUnixFileMode(_databaseFile,
        UnixFileMode.UserRead | UnixFileMode.UserWrite);
}
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Secure password input with masked console display
- ✅ Proper exception handling with UnauthorizedAccessException
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (crypto, storage, UI)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- ✅ Safe JSON serialization with depth limits
- ✅ Proper resource disposal with `using` statements
- ✅ Modern cryptographic algorithms (no deprecated functions)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Memory Security Testing**
   - Verify sensitive data cleared after use
   - Test for memory leaks during extended operation

2. **Input Validation Testing**
   - Test malformed Base32 strings
   - Test path traversal attempts (`../../../etc/passwd`)
   - Test malicious JSON payloads

3. **Cryptographic Testing**
   - Verify TOTP codes match authenticator apps
   - Test encryption/decryption with various passwords
   - Verify salt and IV randomness

## Conclusion

The application now provides strong security for TOTP management with proper encryption, memory handling, and input validation. The remaining low-priority issues are minor and do not pose immediate security risks. The application is suitable for production use with the current security posture.

**Risk Level:** Low
**Recommended Action:** Address remaining low-priority issues in future updates
